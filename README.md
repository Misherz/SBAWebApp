    Let the feeling of existential dread sink in. Also, enjoy some nice photos of Space.


### Technologies Used :

    Per Scholas Slides
    BroCode YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4
    NASA API: https://api.nasa.gov/
    Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/

### How to get started :
    Be surprised with image search function - enter any number in range to see cool photos provided by Nasa.
    Moon will take you to Nasa page
    Type in any city and get the weather

    Nasa's api has requests limits - will generate after an hour request key is disabled, but key will not disable quickly (note)
